# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization

## Overview
This project is a Python-based visualization tool that demonstrates the differences between various pathfinding algorithms. It provides an interactive way to understand how each algorithm explores and finds the shortest path.

## Features

- ✔️ Implements multiple pathfinding algorithms  
- 🎥 Real-time visualization of algorithm execution  
- 🎛️ Customizable grid and obstacles  
- 🖥️ Easy-to-use interface
  
## Algorithms Implemented ## 
- A (A-Star) Algorithm* (Will develop another soon)
